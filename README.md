Audiobook Classification Project
Overview
This project involves the classification of audiobook data using a neural network model. The provided code includes data preprocessing, model training, and prediction on new data.

Files
Audiobooks_data_pt.csv: Preprocessed data containing features and target labels.
Audiobooks_data_testing.csv: New input data for prediction.
your_trained_model_path: Trained neural network model saved during or after training.
Audiobooks_data_train.npz, Audiobooks_data_validation.npz, Audiobooks_data_test.npz: Intermediate data files used during data splitting.
Code Structure
Data Preprocessing:

Load preprocessed data into a DataFrame (df).
Load new input data for prediction.
Model Prediction:

Load the trained neural network model.
Predict classes for the new input data.
Print the predicted class.
Updating DataFrame and Saving Results:

Update the DataFrame with predicted classes.
Save the updated DataFrame to a new CSV file (Audiobooks_data_pt.csv).
Usage
Ensure all required dependencies are installed (tensorflow, numpy, pandas, scikit-learn).
Place the preprocessed data file (Audiobooks_data_pt.csv), new input data file (Audiobooks_data_testing.csv), and the trained model file (your_trained_model_path) in the same directory as the script.
Execute the script to make predictions on new data and update the DataFrame.
Dependencies
